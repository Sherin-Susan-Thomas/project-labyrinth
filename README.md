# Project Labyrinth

The week's assignement was to build a project which allows the user to navigate a labyrinth(text-based adventure). The focus of this week was to build communication with the backend using Thunks and Redux. The project was done by me and Justine.
The  week's project was done using NES-style CSS framework

## The problem
-understanding the logic behind Thunks and how it interacts with redux store's dispatch and useState methods.
